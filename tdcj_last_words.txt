Inmate 1 Last Words:
There is not a day that goes by that I don't regret my actions, I had no right to take your loved ones from you, and I ask and pray; hope and pray that one day you find it in your hearts to forgive me for those actions. No amount of my apologies will ever return them to you. And if you feel that this is what you need to get you closure, I pray it helps you have that closure. I just hope that one day you find that forgiveness to forgive me for taking your loved ones from you. I am deeply sorry. To my mom, my sister, my niece, my lawyers, my supporters, my friends, my family, and everybody I love you. This isn't the end; this is only the beginning. Everybody back at the Polunsky Unit, Field Ministers, Director Hazelwood, Director Dickerson, Major Neyland, and everybody there thank you for you love and support and your compassion and allowing me the opportunity to show you that I can change and become a better man and rehabilitate. I thank God for allowing me to seek him out and finding him and show that this isn't about me. We are all here today because of my actions, but in the end, it comes down to God, praising him and giving honor to him. I have accepted Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior years ago, and I just want you guys to know how deeply sorry I am, but I know when this happens, and this goes through it's going to be the end of this life, but it will be the beginning of my ultimate life in heaven. I'm sorry and as Philippians 1:21 says to live is die to live is Christ and to die is gain, with that said, Warden Strong thank you I am finished.
